# Simple Web Server

This project creates a web server using an Amazon Linux AMI with Apache installed.
The "webpage" index.html is copied from an S3 bucket to the Server.

For reference, the S3 access policy and index page are included here.

This was used to create an Autoscale group for EC2 loadblancing.
